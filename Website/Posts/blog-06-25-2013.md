There is not only one way to achieve physical immortality.   One day when genetic engineering achieves anti-aging capabilities, death could still happen by accident, disease, or if the environment is not habitable.  Some people believe immortality will be achieved by replacing all of our vulnerable meat-like bodies into durable metallic machines.  But I say that a computer with all its infinite computational and storage capabilities cannot replace a human being.  Others believe immortality is achieved in a conceptual sense through contributions such as recognition for generosity.  As Woody Allen said, “I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.”  That’s the kind of immortality I’m talking about - not dying.  The kind of physical immortality I am referring to involves maintaining the “soul”.  I see two necessary technological advancements for achieving physical immortality:

1.  Cyclic-aging: Maintaining the biological physical human form in a youthful state through evolutionary biological changes by genetic engineering.  What I envision is an internal oscillating life cycle that shifts from growing older to growing younger based on thermodynamics (e.g., utilizing cold temperatures and light waves.  After all, life is about entropy.  Nature follows order from disorder.  Death is disorder.  Heat -> cold).  Ideally, a person would grow up to be a sexually mature age of 30 years old and then grow younger to be a juvenile age of 10 years old and then reverse the life cycle to grow back to 30 years old and so on.  This is just an example, the optimal upper rotational age could be 40 years old or older and the lower limit could be some gestational age in utero.

The NY Times published an article on the Jellyfish that could hold the secret to immortality which was discovered in 1988 by Christian Sommers and currently being studied by only one scientist named Shin Kubota in Japan.  The Jellyfish, Turritopsis dohrnii, has been dubbed “The Benjamin Button” jellyfish because of the similar life cycle characteristics of the jellyfish to the main character in the movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  In the movie, Benjamin Button starts his life as an old man then ages in reverse, getting younger until he becomes a baby.  Similarly, the Jellyfish “age in reverse, growing younger and younger until it reached its earliest stage of development, at which point it began its life cycle anew.” – NYTimes, Nathaniel Rich, November 28, 2012.  The Benjamin Button Jellyfish which exhibits this behavior could show us how this could work for humans to achieve immortality.

This is a desirable way of achieving immortality because it involves a continuum of memories and rejuvenation, sloughing off many errors in the body from accumulation of damages.  More research is needed.

WHITEBOARD NOTES: I imagine the genetic algorithm would involve fractals – Apply a repetitive design like fractals of the aperiodic crystal structure of DNA to perpetually sustain the host organism.  The host organism must be born again and experience ‘near’ death cycles ad infinitum.  I will revisit the genetic algorithm portion in a separate post.

2.  Resurrection: Recreating the biological physical human form through cloning.  The premise here is that a person is defined mostly by nature and a little by nurture (epigenetics).  Epigenetics is where experiences determine gene expressions.  The DNA contains the instructions for the resurrection, both the physical body and consciousness (sometimes called the soul).  The consciousness is awakened by recreating a similar early nurturing environment for the clone.  I believe the consciousness arises from the full human form regenerated by its DNA.  The premise is that Life is programmable therefore consciousness is programmable.  The language is DNA.  The second part of Resurrection would involve reviving the memories of the resurrected.

Cyclic-aging is the first line of action because maintaining a continuum of memory is desirable.  According to the TV show series, Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman: “maintaining a continuum of our memories makes us who we are so cloning is not enough.”  I see maintaining a continuum of our memories more of a luxury.  Do you remember anything about your life as an infant?  Does it make a difference to your consciousness today?  Memories decline over time but the core of our being remains the same.  Who we are is programmed by our DNA and maintaining our memories would be an added bonus.

Cyclic-aging sounds almost like a perpetual motion machine which seems to violate the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics which might suggest Immortality is impossible?  Not true.  To say something is impossible is actually unscientific.  The Laws of Thermodynamics is not complete.  Besides, physical immortality fits in the realm of Biological Thermodynamics.  Apparently, life is a struggle for entropy.  According to a NASA scientist James Lovelock, to find signs of life, one must look for a “reduction or a reversal of entropy.”

“In 1875, building on the works of Clausius and Kelvin, Boltzmann reasoned:  The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials – these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available – nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a struggle for [negative] entropy, which becomes available through the transition of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth.[3] “  -- Entropy and Life, From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

How entropy can be manipulated in physical immortality? I’m not entirely sure.  It seems that it would require subatomic level manipulation such as nanotechnology and time travel.  If you’re a physicist, please feel free to chime in any suggestions.  This requires further research including a mathematical proof involving Information Entropy and Entropy S=Quantity/Temperature or more like Gibbs free energy?

Resurrection would be used in the case of fatal circumstances such as an accident or disease.  Resurrection by cloning raises some philosophical and ethical challenges mainly because human cloning technology is not ready yet.  I advocate for treading carefully in achieving human cloning.  We must have a sound ethical understanding of the science before performing any experiments in creating human clones.  We cannot plow forward with experiments on humans by trial and error.  I agree with the current laws on banning human cloning until the procedures are safe.

What is Life?
What is Life?
“What is Life?” is a 1944 non-fiction book written by physicist Erwin Schrodinger which inspired major advances in our understanding of DNA.  He introduced the concept of the aperiodic crystal for DNA structure and announced to the world that “Life is programmable”.

My claim is that the soul is programmable:  Life is programmable  =>  Soul is programmable

Life is programmable so therefore the consciousness (or soul) must be programmable as well.   Consciousness lives and dies with the body.  Based on the premise that life is programmable, my hunch is that clones share the same soul.  Twin studies have shown that identical twins are not the same as clones.  Identical twins’ DNA are not identical whereas a clone’s DNA are identical to its host.  Therefore, identical twins don’t share the same soul.  So if clones share the same soul then can multiple entities with the same soul exist on the same plane?  They could theoretically exist but it feels wrong.  Only one entity with one soul should exist at any one time.  Laws need to be in place so that only 1 unique person can exist at any one time.  That means an infertile couple would not be allowed to conceive their own clones.  What could be acceptable is for the couple to conceive a deceased individual in the same lineage from a previous generation?  As long as that deceased individual was not a threat to society and the deceased individual wanted to be brought back to life.

Reviving the memories of the resurrected would require massive computational capabilities and databases of living memories through captured images, videos, words, sounds, and experiences.  Russian multi-millionaire Dmitry Itskov announced on June 15, 2013 that he is banking on artificial brains by 2045.  This technology could be used to revive the memories of the resurrected.

Yes, there are lots of ethical dilemmas as well as technical challenges that we must overcome.  As a very good friend of mine once said, “I have faith in the justice system”, I too have faith that people will do the right thing.  Our mission should be to take something that is in Disorder (death) and put it into order (immortality).  The next step in human evolution is immortality.
