When I was younger I watched a TV show segment called The Muppet Show - Pigs in Space: The End of the Universe which claimed to know the meaning and purpose of life.  This was a time before DVD's, DVR's and YouTube - so I was glued to the TV anyways but I remember being particularly captivated as I waited one delay after another.  Little did I know at the time I was living in the dark ages, information was not readily available like it is today.  The show ended quite abruptly with no answer.

This intriguing question: "What is the meaning and purpose of life?" serves as a guide in the search for immortality.  Anytime this question is answered with "alas, there is no meaning and purpose", that's a clue to look elsewhere.

As far as we have known, death has been life's change agent and sexual reproduction is how genetic information is transferred from one generation to the next with random variations to ensure survival for the human species.  The cumulative damages to an aging person's body has ultimately been resolved by death.  The problem with letting nature take its course (let live and let die) is that the individual gets lost for eternity in death.  This does not have to be our reality; we have the power to charter our destiny.  We're getting close to changing this shared reality through active participation which began as having faith in an afterlife.  When having that talk with our innocent loved ones about the meaning of life and death, rather than discussing an abstract afterlife we can discuss the reality of immortality.  We have the capability of maintaining an individual's DNA indefinitely by storing the DNA information on multimedia.  Perhaps one day, without DNA samples or any recorded DNA information, an individual's DNA may be reverse engineered from information about family history.

Immortality will be a collaborative effort through natural selection.  A person cannot be immortal in isolation.  Resurrection requires approval by a consensus.  If collectively we must decide who is allowed to live forever then perhaps life itself is a collective phenomena.  So what would be the point of achieving individual physical immortality if sexual reproduction effectively grants us collective immortality?  Is consciousness over-rated in the grand scheme of life?

Most people who live by, "do unto others as you would like them to do unto you," usually fare better than those who don't.  Why is that?  Could it be because the people you see all around is an illusion and we all share the same consciousness?  And karma is just you keeping yourself in check.  This idea that you or I could be all alone in the universe and could be looking into a mirror inside a mirror within a mirror suggests there is no meaning and purpose of life.  I am not too keen on this idea of one consciousness in the universe.  This is just one of many theories about consciousness which explores a step beyond self-awareness and an example of having to choose what to believe.

Perhaps life is interconnected as taught by Buddhism?  This idea of interconnectedness, while recognizing the importance of individuality, explains nicely how an individual who is conscientious of others has a better chance of survival than someone who does not live harmoniously with others.  Every person has a unique consciousness and every action has a reaction, cause and effect, and consequences that work together in the world.  Achieving physical immortality requires radically different ways of thinking from the perspective of the microcosmos to the macro-cosmos.

A brave new synthetic world lies ahead in a movement toward immortality.

Inspirational artists have hinted at the possibility.  Scientists have built the infrastructure.  There are gold minefields of information available on the internet.  It has only been until now that we're so close to achieving immortality because we can have these conversations without restraints.  By understanding consciousness, discussing "why we need to achieve physical immortality" as well as "how we can achieve physical immortality" we might actually get there.

Humans can learn so much more and do so much more than eat, drink and sleep.

What any great individual accomplishes in one century will never be enough.  The goal here is not about creating life for our amusement but rather for curing diseases and in particular preventing death from old age.

What is the meaning and purpose of life?  The answer is out there.  After all, life is a journey; not a destination.  Anyone who is driven to live forever chooses a life with meaning and purpose.  It is a choice.  You can wait around for the answer or you can search for yourself or not or you can go eat dinner or do all of the above.  Ultimately your decisions have an impact on the universe and if you're ever one of the worthy ones to reach the end of the universe, be sure to write down the answer!
